# full-stack-sample-app

A simple Full-Stack sample app that can be used in workshops. The frontend client is written in React and the backend server in Express. The app shows a webpage with a button that a user can click to display a random number.

The FE client was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The BE server was generated with the Express default generator.
